Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

  The client The Gaming Room was looking for a client/server based gaming that could be played on multiple operation software. The game they wanted developed was "Draw it or Loose it" 
  and required the sever to store the gaming function and allow client side to access the server to play the game. 
  
What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

  I felt I understand the full scope well. This allowed me to fully document all the information the client was looking for. 

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

  I found working through this design document helpful because it helped break down the process of what a client will be looking for a consultant. 
  it helps both the client and consultant on what is the end result and allows the client to have a good understanding on what steps the consultant is taking. 
  
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

  One part is being able to speek on some of the operation software sections more intelligently. I can improve this by gaining a better understanding of the 
  OS software. 
  
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

  I interpretted the users needs and implemented them based on their design requirements. Having a good understanding of their end game and their requirements allows 
  what steps to take for a design. 
  
How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
  I found it interesting using the MAVEN software with Java. I found this to be a usually tool when setting up a larger code to link to a HTTP address. Knowing how to use
  this tool, I would use it again for a software requiring a connection to a client and server.
